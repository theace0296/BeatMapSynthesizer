# Instructions for Downloading Models

The Python pickle files that store the Hidden Markov Models are too large for GitHub to host unzipped. You have two options for acquiring the model files:

1. Unzip the `HMM_model.zip` folder, and place all of the files in the `models/` folder of your repo.

2. Train the models yourself using the scripts provided (more details coming.)
