# Instructions for Downloading Models

The Python pickle files that store the Hidden Markov Models are too large for GitHub to host. You have two options for acquiring the model files:

1. Download [this zipped folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p7j0sENy0DzcMHd3iQ_LQw14j6OcKLsY) of the models. Unzip the folder, and place all of the files in the `models/` folder of your repo.

2. Train the models yourself using the scripts provided (more details coming.)
