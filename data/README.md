# Data Acquisition and Processing

If you're interested in training models yourself, you can acquire the data used for training in two ways:

1. Download [this zipped folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18l7p0K_gwRQ4NSVnuRGlqcM95TFsdbi6) of the processed data I used for training my models, then follow the instructions in the `HMM.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to train the models yourself.
2. Follow the instructions in the `Download Data.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to download and process data directly from the beatsaver.com API. This is very slow. I do not suggest it unless you want to watch songs download for over 24 hours.
