# Example Custom Maps

These are examples of the files that are necessary to make a custom map that Beat Saber can read. They consist of multiple files that are zipped together when downloaded from beatsaver.com.

1. `info.dat`: a JSON-style file that tells Beat Saber what files are in the directory and other important information about the custom maps.

2. `song.egg`: a music file in .OGG format but for some reason named .egg `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

3. `difficulty.dat`: a JSON-style file that contains all the data needed for Beat Saber to correctly place all of the blocks ('notes'), obstacles, and lighting events during the course of the song.

4. `cover.jpg`: 256x265 image to be displayed in the game as the cover art for the song.

Thank you to the mappers who made these files originally!
